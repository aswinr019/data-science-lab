# Given is a list of of words, wordlist, and a string, name. Write a Python
# function which takes wordlist and name as input and returns a tuple.
# The first element of the output tuple is the number of words in the
# wordlist which have name as a substring in it. The second element of
# the tuple is a list showing the index at which the name occurs in each of
# the words of the wordlist and a 0 if it doesnâ€™t occur.
